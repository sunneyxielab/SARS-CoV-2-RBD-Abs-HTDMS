# SARS-CoV-2-RBD-Abs-HTDMS
High-throughput deep mutational scanning processing procedure

This repo contains code for processing deep mutational scanning data (it is a modified version of [J. Bloom's pipeline](https://github.com/jbloomlab/SARS-CoV-2-RBD_DMS)), and code for reproducing figures and analysis in [our paper](https://biorxiv.org).

Thanks to [the Bloom lab](https://research.fhcrc.org/bloom/en.html) for their fantastic deep mutational scanning technology and data processing pipeline. Refer to [Sunney Xie lab](https://sunneyxielab.org) for more information.
